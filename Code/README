Overall Description: This folder contains the main code used in the analysis of our experiments. The scripts are used as follows: Initial correlation analysis for actual and simulated electrophysiological data (Single untis and LFP) are calculated and stored in "Bootstrap Testing.ipynb". The stored files are in the python pickle format. These stored files are then unpackaged and processed in "Output_Bootstrap_Data.ipynb". This file has multiple scripts, which involve unpacking the data to be used for further statistical analysis or as outputs for figures. The file "NeuronVasomotionFunc.py" is simply a file that is imported in the previous scripts, containing newly defined functions. The file "Neuron Data Analysis.ipynb" is a script which analyzes the data at an experiment level.
